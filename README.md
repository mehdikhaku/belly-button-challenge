# **Belly Button Biodiversity**

## Module 14 Challenge

The project aims to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset (https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels.

The dashboard includes:
- dropdown to examine data from each individual
- bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)
- bubble chart featuring all microbial species

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
